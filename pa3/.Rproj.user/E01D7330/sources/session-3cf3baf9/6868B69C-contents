# Summary
For this programming assignment, we worked with the "heid" data set included in the language R package in R. This data set looks at lexical decision latencies for words ending in -heid. First, the descriptive statistical test that we performed showed us the average (mean) reaction time (RT) and the standard deviation (SD) by word (n = 34). Second, we selected the two continuous variables in the data set (base frequency and reaction time) and performed a bivariate regression. The results indicate that there is a statistically significant correlation (p = .0266) between both variables, although very weak (Î² = -0.016637). Third, we represented this information in a scatter plot. On the x-axis we have our predictor variable (base frequency) and on our y-axis we have our response variable or dependent variable (reaction time). Because the beta (slope) of the regression was so low, we can conclude that there is no practical effect of the frequency of the word on reaction time.
